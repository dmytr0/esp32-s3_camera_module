- Features：
The ESP32-S3 SPK is a feature-rich, compact and portable iot development
board.The development version is powered by a 240 MHz Tensilica Xtensa LX7 COMF
processor, MSM261D3526H1CPM microphone and NS4168 power amplifier for
recording and playback, and 16M flash for storing program code and data, as well as
external flash memory and external 8M PSRAM extensions, to meet greater
capacity storage requirements. Support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication,
provides rich peripheral interfaces, including multiple general serial buses (SPI, I2C,
UART), GPIO pins, ADC, DAC. These interfaces can be used to connect various sensors,
actuators, and external devices. This development version supports programming
using the Arduino development environment, and also provides an ESP-IDF
development framework for lower-level programming and system debugging.
